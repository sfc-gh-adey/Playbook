### What This Is (and Isn't)

*   ✅ **A communication tool:** An interactive blueprint for engineering.
*   ✅ **For validating user flows:** Gather feedback on the user experience.
*   ✅ **Visually consistent:** Built with production-ready design components.

*   ❌ **Production code:** Its purpose is simulation, not implementation.
*   ❌ **A replacement for engineering:** Engineering teams will build the final product.
